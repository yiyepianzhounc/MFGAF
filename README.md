# Beat LLMs at Their Own Game: Zero-Shot LLM-Generated Text Detection via Querying ChatGPT
## Data
* For the Finance dataset, we use the ChatGPT-generated texts collected by Guo et al. [1]
* The human-written texts and ChatGPT-generated texts of the Finance dataset are in the finance.jsonl file.
* The ChatGPT-revised version for human-written texts of the Finance dataset is in the revised_human_finance.txt file.
* The ChatGPT-revised version for ChatGPT-generated texts of the Finance dataset is in the revised_chatgpt_finance.txt file.
* When we revise texts with ChatGPT, we use the
gpt-3.5-turbo API provided by OpenAI. All experiments that call gpt-3.5-turbo API in
the paper are done before June 2023, with the gpt-3.5-turbo API being gpt-3.5-turbo-0301.
## Code
* To evaluate the detection performance of our method on the Finance dataset, please run the code "python finance_bart_auroc.py".
  
  We use the BARTScore-CNN [2] as
the similarity metric to calculate similarity scores.
